    <p>
      This site is an example of how psychological manipulation could be used to lure users into playing a "game" that reveals hidden messages across various websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      A malicious attacker might use topics like adult content or sensational articles about weapons to catch your attention and keep you engaged. These topics are chosen purely for demonstration purposes to highlight the risk ‚Äî no actual adult content or weapons are presented here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how the text below explains how an attacker might craft such a scenario:
    </p>
    <p>
      "By using emotional triggers and curiosity, attackers can manipulate users into participating in a dangerous game that gradually compromises their privacy and security."
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is part of a controlled Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to demonstrate the risk of hidden messages and social engineering. No personal data is collected, and this is for educational purposes only.
